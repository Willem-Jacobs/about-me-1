## about-me

I built a quiz for people to learn more about me. Humble, I know. It greets the user and prompts for their name. It then requests they answer the following five questions with Yes or No. If they are wrong, it will alert with a correct message. If correct, it will congratulate. It then thanks the user and asks user to come back again.
