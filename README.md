## LAB 2-5

## about-me

I built a quiz for people to learn more about me. Humble, I know. It greets the user and prompts for their name. It then requests they answer the following five questions with Yes or No. If they are wrong, it will alert with a correct message. If correct, it will congratulate. It then thanks the user and asks user to come back again.

### Reflections and Comments

* Bookmarking the Styling Scrapbook for future design questions. I think it will help as I try to make sites or applications that can be usable to everyone regardless of potential limitations from equipment like mobile devices or phycial limitations.

* Overall, I think this lab went well. I was a little lost with the css, as it has been 4 months since I finished my last class and with life did not study nearly as much as I had hoped to. However, the guys in Remo were awesome and helped out a lot.

* This took a lot longer than I originally expected because I kept coming back and fixing or embellishing before it was actually completed. Especially since I had probably 2/3 of it done before class was done. I think on the next lab I will get the bones done first, then come back to embellish and fix, with the timer going the whole time!

* It still trips me out to think that I created a web site. And I keep learning more each day to make it better.

* I think a stretch goal will be to figure out to get my pictures to have the caption displayed. It turns out it is not actually the title in the img tag.
